Network design algorithm based on Iterative Reweighted L1 norm minimization
Dataset scripts:    
    - load_dataset_catalonia.py Merges multiple air pollution datasets into a single file
    - dataset_preprocessing.py cleans air pollution dataset from missing and other techniques
    - NOAA_dataset.py loads NOAA SST files, perform image preprocessing technique and create snapshots matrix for the method

Methods scripts:
    - sensor_placement.py performs typical sensor placement algorithms (D-optimal, rankMax, etc)

Main scripts:
    - network_planning.py performs main algorithm on Air pollution dataset
    - network_design_SST.py performs main algorithm on SST dataset
