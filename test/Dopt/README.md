Sensor locations results obtained from Joshi-Boyd algorithm.
The number of monitored locations is obtained from the network design algorithm.
Then, from that number of sensors the Joshi-Boyd algorithm is used to obtain a different distribution of sensors and compare with the previous results.
----
There are results for homogeneous and heterogeneous threshold constraints.
