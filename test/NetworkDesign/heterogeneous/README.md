Each pkl file contains coordinates of monitored and unmonitored locations for Catalonia Air pollution network.
The indices are sorted with idx 0 being Ciutadella location. As the index increases the location is further away from Ciutadella station.
Normal IRNet algorithm parameters include epsilon=1e-2 and n_it = 50. 
As epsilon decreases more locations are monitored.
If using large epsilon (~1e-1) and low threshold ratios (~1.1) the solution might not fullfill the required threshold design.
If using low epsilon (~1e-2) and large threshold ratios (~1.4) the algorithm might select too many locations.

Parameters:
N=48,s=36
