Sparsity folder contains results of SVD for air polution dataset
There are two different networks.
Network 1 with N=44 potantial locations
- If sparsity is obtained from cumulative energy: s=34
- If sparsity is obtained from RMSE: s=28 (or 30)

Network 2 with N=48 potential locations
- If sparsity if obtained from cumulative energy: s=36
- If sparsity is obtained from RMSE: s=30
